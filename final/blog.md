In today’s fast-paced business environment, executives at small to mid-sized companies often face the daunting task of reviewing legal documents. The stakes are high—misunderstandings or overlooked changes can lead to costly mistakes. But what if you could streamline this process, saving time and reducing errors? Genie AI’s new Document Compare feature promises just that.

## What is the Document Compare Feature?

Genie AI’s Document Compare feature is designed to simplify the review process for busy leaders. By integrating a native diff engine within Genie’s real-time editor, this tool allows users to compare two documents side-by-side or against an external file (like DOCX or PDF). This means you can quickly identify changes, whether they are additions, deletions, or moved paragraphs, without the headache of manual scrolling.

The feature provides both a side-by-side view and a unified diff view, making it easy to spot discrepancies at a glance. It’s user-friendly and built for non-lawyers, ensuring that you don’t need a legal background to navigate complex changes.

## How It Works

Using the Document Compare feature is straightforward. Here’s how you can get started:

1. **Select Your Documents**: Choose two documents from Genie or upload an external file.
2. **Initiate Comparison**: Click on the Document Compare option within the editor.
3. **View Changes**: Review the side-by-side or unified diff view to see what’s new, removed, or altered.
4. **Share Easily**: Quickly share the comparison with co-founders or legal counsel for feedback.
